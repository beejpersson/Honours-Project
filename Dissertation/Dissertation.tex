\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
This project has three main background components to discuss. These are mixed reality, the Microsoft HoloLens and Vuforia.

\subsubsection{Mixed Reality}
\paragraph{Virtual Continuum}
Mixed reality (MR) is a variation of virtual environments, or virtual reality. A virtual environment is one in which a user is immersed inside a synthetic environment. Whilst in this environment the user cannot see the real world around them, what they see is entirely virtual. In a mixed reality environment, however, the user is able to see aspects of both the real world and super-imposed virtual objects. MR "supplements reality, rather than completely replacing it" \cite{azuma97}.

MR is often considered as encompassing both augmented reality (AR) and augmented virtuality (AV), both of which reside along the "virtuality continuum", a term coined by Milgram and Kishino in 1994  \cite{milgram94}, with the real world at one end and the virtual at the other. AR refers to an otherwise real world environment in which there can be seen virtual augmentations, often viewed through a clear screen. AV, conversely, attempts to merge real world scenery or objects into an otherwise virtual world.
\paragraph{Applications and Devices}
The nature of combining real and virtual objects can be utilised in a variety of ways and can enhance a user's ability to perform certain tasks and interact with the world. Whilst initially prevalent in the arts and entertainment industries, MR has a number of practical uses and is being taken advantage of by businesses today, particularly in the fields of military training, manufacturing and education \cite{evans17, hughes97}. Many devices utilise these virtual environments, such as the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, headsets that need to be connected to a computer or console, both released in 2016, but the Microsoft HoloLens is one of the few standalone devices available that offers mixed reality capabilities in a head-mounted display.

\subsubsection{Microsoft HoloLens}

The Microsoft HoloLens is a mixed reality holographic head-mounted display unit with an adjustable cushioned headband released in 2016 \cite{microsoftcorp}. It is "the first fully untethered holographic computer running Windows 10", enabling a mixed reality experience with no wires, no external cameras and no connection to a PC required \cite{holmdahl15}.
\paragraph{Hardware, Sensors and Features}
The optics are two separate displays, which are viewed through glass lenses, on to which images are projected and layered to produced what the user can see in their space. The HoloLens' system is essentially mobile hardware featuring an Intel Cherry Trail Atom chip, housing the central processing unit and graphical processing unit, a 64GB SSD and 2GB of RAM and based on x86 architecture \cite{rubino16}. Additionally, however, it runs a few processors that make it unique. There is an inertial measurement unit (IMU), which includes an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, and there is an aptly name Holographic Processing Unit (HPU), that handles where the user is looking, gesture tracking, spacial mapping and more. \cite{holmdahl15}.

It has four "environment understanding cameras", two on each side, which provide the basis for tracking the user's head; a depth camera, which helps with hand tracking and performs surface reconstruction (for placing holograms on physical objects); a video camera and an ambient light sensor. These sensors work with the optics module and the IMU and is packaged for the Intel Atom chip by the HPU to produce fast response times to movement so that the user's position is updated and displayed in less than 10ms to ensure the holograms feel part of the world. The HoloLens also features four microphones for user commands, mounted stereo speakers providing spatial sound and both WiFi and bluetooth \cite{colaner16}.
\paragraph{Practical Applications}
As of 2018 there has only been a few practical applications of the Microsoft HoloLens and a number of them have only been proof of concepts so far. Notably there has been a number of applications developed by NASA in partnership with Microsoft. In 2015 they teamed up for the OnSight and Sidekick projects, utilising the HoloLens on the International Space Station for communication and real-time guidance with ground operators, and later again in 2017 to help find the best places on Mars to build bases \cite{nasa15, microsoftnews17}. There are also examples of use in medicine in 2017: a team of surgeons used the HoloLens to visualise MRI and radiography information whilst operating on a patient with a malignant tumour patient \cite{bernardo17, 3ders17}; a ultrasound training simulation was designed to teach healthcare workers proficiency in anatomy through the use of interaction with 3D holograms of internal human structures \cite{lynn17, mahmood17}.

\section{Initial Project Overview}
 \ \\ \textbf{SOC10101 Honours Project (40 Credits)} \\ \\
\textbf{Title of Project:} \\
Real world object-capture in a mixed-reality environment. \\ \\
\textbf{Overview of Project Content and Milestones:} \\
This project will look to evaluate the effectiveness of capturing real world objects using Vuforia on the Microsoft HoloLens. Initially, a method to capture a simple object will be developed, before attempts to capture more complex (or multiple) objects and real-time object manipulation will be implemented. The project aims to explore to what extent this can be done. \\
The milestones will be: 
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0pt
	\item simple object capture
	\item simple object manipulation
	\item complex object capture
	\item real-time object manipulation.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{The Main Deliverable(s):} \\
Object capture and manipulation software. \\

\section{Report on the Interim Review Meeting}
\ \\ \textbf{SOC10101 Honours Project (40 Credits)} \\                   
\textbf{Week 9 Report} \\ \\
\textbf{Student Name:} Beej Persson \\
\textbf{Supervisor:} Kevin Chalmers \\
\textbf{Second Marker:}  Gregory Leplatre \\
\textbf{Date of Meeting:}  20/11/2017 \\
Can the student provide evidence of attending supervision meetings by means of project diary sheets or other equivalent mechanism?  \textbf{no*} \\
\indent If not, please comment on any reasons presented \\
\textsl{No evidence provided but no indication from supervisor that there was a problem with weekly meeting attendance.} \\ \\ \\
Please comment on the progress made so far \\ \\
\textsl{The work done focused on identifying ways of working with a Hololens, i.e., the output side of the project. This was useful, but the main challenge of the project is object recognition and augmentation, which would have been useful to deal with earlier. This would also have allowed you to engage with relevant literature on the subject.} \\ \\ \\
Is the progress satisfactory? \textbf{unsure} \\
Can the student articulate their aims and objectives? \textbf{Partly} \\
If yes then please comment on them, otherwise write down your suggestions. \\ \\
\textsl{The overall goal (altering the appearance of real-world objects using AR) is clear. What specific alterations, to which objects and in which context remains to be determined. Familiarity with relevant literature will help you specify your project more accurately. Many things are possible, some more complex than others. For this type of project, a good approach would be to consider what operation would have the highest visual impact while having a manageable development cost. There is definitely potential in your project.} \\ \\ \\	
Does the student have a plan of work? \textbf{Yes} \\
If yes then please comment on that plan otherwise write down your suggestions. \\ \\
\textsl{Unfortunately, the plan is limited to work already done.} \\ \\ \\
Does the student know how they are going to evaluate their work? \textbf{partly} \\
If yes then please comment otherwise write down your suggestions. \\ \\
\textsl{The proposed approach is sensible but it is difficult to be more specific at this stage as the functionalities of the system aren’t clearly defined.} \\ \\
Any other recommendations as to the future direction of the project \\ \\
\textsl{With Vuforia, you should be able to capture objects in a scene (in advance) and then track these objects. The acquisition/tracking effectiveness probably depends on the complexity of the object, which you should establish. Once you know the limits of what you will be able to track, you can focus on real-time alterations. Your incremental development approach is suitable, but it needs to be better controlled. Once you know what you are aiming to do, you can define the incremental steps that will lead you there. The core of the research in this area is about achieving realism, which involves lighting and material acquisition. Potentially impactful results can also be achieved by taking slighting different directions. Giving an object a stylised look is one of them. Anecdotally, magic tricks are high impact and can be technically cheap. A magic trick you could implement could be: give a physical object to a user (that you will have previously scanned with Vuforia). Ask them to put it on a table (that you have also previously scanned), and make the object disappear (assuming the user is wearing a Hololens).} \\ \\
